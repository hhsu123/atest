## use case/user story: 
- As a retailer I can input my state code, the quantity and the unit price of certain product, so that the calculator can show me the total price accordingly. 

_Questions to understand the MVP, and the scope of this assignment_
  - no multiple products for the calculation? 
  - 1 state code for the total price and the state code is unlikely to change once it's configured?
  - the state could be only 1 of the 5 given ones? 

## thoughts about overall approaches:
- 
  -> minimum set of required user interaction -> key function(s) to achieve sunny day scenario 
- 
  -> MVP user interaction -> MVP function(s) 
- 
  -> usability -> robust code


### Tasks:
1. A compoment for user to select 1 state out of the 5.  
2. A compoment for user to input 
3.
