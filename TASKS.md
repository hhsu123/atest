## use case/user story: 
- As a retailer I can input my state code, the quantity and the unit price of certain product, so that the calculator can show me the total price accordingly. 

_Questions to understand the MVP, and the scope of this assignment_
  - no multiple products for the calculation? 
  - 1 state code for the total price and the state code is unlikely to change once it's configured?
  - the state could be only 1 of the 5 given ones? 

## thoughts about overall approaches:
- 
  -> minimum set of required user interaction -> key function(s) to achieve sunny day scenario 
- 
  -> MVP user interaction -> function(s) for MVP sunny day scnearios
- 
  -> MVP userability -> function(s) for MVP usability including rainy day scnearios etc.


### Tasks:
- a basic script to take in command line input for the 3 factors, and respond with calculated result in command line.
- a component to input the quantity
- a component to input the unit price
- a component to select 2-letter state code
- a component to display the calculated result
